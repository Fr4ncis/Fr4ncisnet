  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Who am I</p>
  <p style="font-size:14px;">
  I am a freelance professional based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, offering my services as an iOS developer. I worked on different apps, both native and webview 
  based, and I can develop web services in order to provide complete solutions.<br />
  My problem solving and development skills are built on the solid ground of a BSc in Telecommunication Engineering and a MSc in Computer Engineering from 
  University of Padua, Italy. Throughout the years I developed various web applications and worked in different team projects, using mainly Ruby on Rails and Java 
  technologies.

  <p style="font-size:14px;">
  I strongly believe in lean methodology, and I apply it as much as possible to ship products with high quality and value.
  I also make use of agile development to achieve higher quality and perform better in teams, providing constant feedback to customers.<br />
