  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Create apps from scratch</p>
  <p>Given just guidelines or complete wireframes and design specifications, I can develop either native or web-based apps, with the option of developing backend web services as well.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Building integrated solutions</p>
  <p>In case an app accessing network is needed, I can take care of designing and developing web services on both ends (mobile and server). The key is making use of the best technologies around in order to achieve the best quality with cost-effectiveness.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Quality and delivery</p>
  <p>Going through iterations and continuous feedback on the state of the product, you as a customer will have access to the latest build available in order to establish a dialog towards the final product. The goal is satisfaction and quality, product delivered on time, no surprises.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Building components</p>
  <p>You may have already a product in place, but you may want to give it that little extra touch to make it stand apart from the competition. I can build customized views, non-standard controllers, animations that will make your app look just beautiful.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Network-based solutions</p>
  <p>I can build complete network-based solutions: from a simple client/server data exchange to development of optimized transfer protocols or customized peer-to-peer networks to suit customers' needs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Technologies I make use of</p>
<p>Objective-C, Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jquery/Jquery Mobile, Parse.com, Cloudmine, CoreData, SQLLite, TestFlight, BugSense.</p>
